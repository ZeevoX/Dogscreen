# Dogscreen
Dogscreen is an example on how to implement Google-style dogfood notices.

### Latest release: v1.1

Have you ever tried out one of Google's leaked internal application releases? Did you want to add that style notice to your own application? With Dogscreen by ZeevoX, you can easily implement such a notice.

See the demo code for how to use it. You can also try out the demo app by downloading the APK from the [release page.](https://github.com/ZeevoX/Dogscreen/releases)

### A more detailed README.md will be available soon.
